Nobody really ever reads this stuff.

Questions, comments, concerns, message Kerynna or Spence in game or CaptainReaper in Discord.

If you want to add images, make edits, do whatever, go ahead and test it on your own accord. Any changes
that you make and send back should be documented in another test file in the same directory as this ReadMe file.
